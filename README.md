# Python-Reading-CSV-Files-From-Multiple-Directories

When data is stored in multiple directories (folders), we need to load all these individual files and finally merge them into one DataFrame. 
In this notebook, step by step, we will explain the above concept. We work with datasets that are CSV files (Comma-separated values). 
The dataset we use in this project is an integral part of this repository.
